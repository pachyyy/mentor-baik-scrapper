# Explanation
This is a simple application made with python to scrape data from mentorbaik.com that I make. It will call the api then extract all of the json based on the field that is listed on main.py. The mentors.json is a json that contains the mentors name, id, username, etc. I'm not providing the file because of privacy.

## Instruction
1. pip install playwright pandas requests
2. After installing all the neccessary package, create payload.py for saving the bearer_token and the api_url
